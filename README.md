# Research Thesis Work

## Overview
This repository is part of my research thesis work and contains data files, code, and tools essential for my analysis. The repository is organized into multiple branches to maintain clarity and structure.

## Branches

### Main Branch
- **Purpose**: Contains CSV files that are critical to my research.
- **Dataset Source**: The CSV files were obtained from the following dataset:
  [CDC Dataset: Respiratory Virus Response (RVR) United States Hospitalization Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Respiratory-Virus-Response-RVR-United-States-Hospi/9t9r-e5a3/about_data)

### Notebooks Branch
- **Purpose**: Contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) used for data processing, analysis, and visualization related to the research.

### Darts Package Branch
- **Purpose**: Contains code that utilizes the `darts` package, which supports modeling with exogenous variables. This branch is specifically tailored for advanced time series forecasting and analysis.

## Instructions
- **Main Branch**: Access CSV files used in the research.
- **Notebooks Branch**: Explore Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
- **Darts Package Branch**: Review and use the code that leverages the `darts` package for time series forecasting.

## License and Citation
Please ensure proper citation of the CDC dataset if used in any publication or analysis. The dataset is available on the [CDC website](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Respiratory-Virus-Response-RVR-United-States-Hospi/9t9r-e5a3/about_data).
