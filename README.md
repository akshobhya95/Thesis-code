# Research Thesis Work

## Overview
This repository is part of my research thesis work and is organized into two branches:
- **`csv-files`**: Contains the CSV files relevant to the dataset used in my research.
- **`notebooks`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) for data analysis and visualization.

## CSV Files
The CSV files in this repository are derived from the dataset titled **"Respiratory Virus Response (RVR) United States Hospitalization Data"**, which was downloaded from the following link:

[CDC Dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Respiratory-Virus-Response-RVR-United-States-Hospi/9t9r-e5a3/about_data)

This dataset includes critical data that supports the analysis and findings discussed in my research thesis.

## Branch Structure
- **`csv-files`**: This branch is dedicated solely to the CSV files associated with the research. These files were obtained from the CDC dataset mentioned above.
- **`notebooks`**: This branch contains Jupyter notebooks used to process, analyze, and visualize the data from the CSV files.

## Instructions
1. **CSV Files**: Switch to the `csv-files` branch to access the dataset in CSV format.
2. **Notebooks**: Switch to the `notebooks` branch to explore the Jupyter notebooks that include the code and analysis performed as part of the research.

## License and Citation
Please ensure proper citation of the CDC dataset if used in any publication or analysis. The dataset can be accessed and downloaded from the [CDC website](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Respiratory-Virus-Response-RVR-United-States-Hospi/9t9r-e5a3/about_data).
