# Research Thesis Work

## Overview

This repository supports my research thesis by providing essential data files, code, and tools for analysis. The repository is organized into folders within the main branch to ensure clarity and effective management of resources.

## Main Branch

### Folder Structure
- **`csv-files/`**: Contains CSV files critical to the research. Some files are compressed in `.7z` format due to their large size.
- **`ipynb-files/`**: Includes Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **`darts-code-and-results/`**: Houses all Python scripts (`.py` files) related to the research, along with the results in PDF and `.tex` formats.

### Dataset Source
The CSV files are sourced from the [CDC Dataset: Respiratory Virus Response (RVR) United States Hospitalization Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Respiratory-Virus-Response-RVR-United-States-Hospi/9t9r-e5a3/about_data).

### Notes
- Some files in this branch are compressed in `.7z` format to reduce storage space. Use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or a similar tool to extract these files.

## Instructions

- **Accessing Files**: Navigate to the appropriate folders to access CSV files, Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts, and results in PDF and `.tex` formats.
- **Decompressing Files**: Extract `.7z` files using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or a compatible tool as needed.

## License and Citation

Please ensure proper citation of the CDC dataset if used in any publication or analysis. The dataset is available on the [CDC website](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Respiratory-Virus-Response-RVR-United-States-Hospi/9t9r-e5a3/about_data).
