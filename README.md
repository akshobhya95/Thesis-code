# Research Thesis Work

## Overview

This repository supports my research thesis by providing essential data files, code, and tools for analysis. It is organized into several branches to ensure clarity and effective management of resources.

## Branches

### Main Branch
- **Purpose**: Contains three main folders:
  - **`csv-files/`**: Includes CSV files critical to the research. Some files are in `.7z` format due to their large size.
  - **`ipynb-files/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
  - **`py-files/`**: Houses Python scripts (`.py` files) used in the analysis.
- **Dataset Source**: The CSV files are sourced from the [CDC Dataset: Respiratory Virus Response (RVR) United States Hospitalization Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Respiratory-Virus-Response-RVR-United-States-Hospi/9t9r-e5a3/about_data).
- **Note**: Some files in this branch are compressed in `.7z` format to reduce storage space. Use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or a similar tool to extract these files.

### Notebooks Branch
- **Purpose**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) used for data analysis, processing, and visualization related to the research.
- **Note**: Some notebooks may also be in `.7z` compressed format. Extract these files as needed.

### Darts Package Branch
- **Purpose**: Contains code that utilizes the `darts` package, designed for advanced time series forecasting and analysis with exogenous variables.
- **Note**: Similar to other branches, some files may be in `.7z` compressed form. Decompress these files before use.

## Instructions

- **Main Branch**: Access CSV files, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python scripts as needed. Extract any `.7z` compressed files using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or a compatible tool.
- **Notebooks Branch**: Explore and run the Jupyter Notebooks for analysis. Decompress `.7z` files if applicable.
- **Darts Package Branch**: Review and utilize the code for time series forecasting. Ensure `.7z` files are extracted before use.

## License and Citation

Please ensure proper citation of the CDC dataset if used in any publication or analysis. The dataset is available on the [CDC website](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Respiratory-Virus-Response-RVR-United-States-Hospi/9t9r-e5a3/about_data).
