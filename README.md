Research Thesis Work
Overview
This repository supports my research thesis by providing essential data files, code, and tools for analysis. It is organized into several branches to ensure clarity and effective management of resources.

Branches
Main Branch
Purpose: This branch contains three main folders:
csv-files/: Includes CSV files critical to the research. Some files are in .7z format due to their large size.
ipynb-files/: Contains Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
py-files/: Houses Python scripts (.py files) used in the analysis.
Dataset Source: The CSV files are sourced from the CDC Dataset: Respiratory Virus Response (RVR) United States Hospitalization Data.
Note: Due to large file sizes, some files in this branch are compressed in .7z format. Use a tool like 7-Zip to extract these files.
Notebooks Branch
Purpose: Contains Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) for conducting data analysis, processing, and visualization specific to the research.
Note: Some notebooks may be compressed in .7z format. Extract these files as needed.
Darts Package Branch
Purpose: Includes code utilizing the darts package for advanced time series forecasting and analysis with exogenous variables.
Note: Some files in this branch may also be in .7z compressed format. Decompress these files before use.
Instructions
Main Branch: Navigate to the appropriate folders to access CSV files, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python scripts. Decompress .7z files using 7-Zip or similar tools.
Notebooks Branch: Review and run Jupyter Notebooks for analysis. Extract .7z files if applicable.
Darts Package Branch: Examine and utilize the code for time series forecasting. Ensure .7z files are extracted prior to use.
